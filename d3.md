#D3.js

##D3 is  library for creating visualizations
- The power of d3 comes from using selections to **combine** data with webpage elements
- D3 is about deriving the appearance of web page elements from bound data

## Select and change
Before modifying anything in d3, you must first select the elements that will be modified. The selection methods come in 2 flavors:
- d3.select() - selects the first element found that matches selector
- d3.selectAll() - selects all that matches selector
```
d3.select('div');
d3.selectAll('strong');
```

Once a selection has been made, you can modify the selection by chaining specific methods on the selection.
```
d3.select('div').style("border", "1px solid red");
d3.select('div').attr('class', 'header');
d3.select('div').property('checked', 'checked');
```

### classed()
The classed method allows you to add or remove a class instead of overwriting the entire value of the class method
```
d3.selectAll('div').classed('test', true); //adds the 'test' class
d3.selectAll('div').classed('out', false); //removes  the 'out' class if present
```

##SVG
- D3 usually is used to draw on and create SVG elements.
- SVG has various elements such as ```<rect> , <circle> and <line>```
- the ```<g>``` element is used to group elements together
- TODO: transform attr of g element

##Binding Data
###.data()
- The ```.data``` method binds data to the current selection in a one to one mapping
```
var nums = [1,2,3,4];
d3.selectAll('div').data(nums);
```
###.enter()
- If there are more data elements than elements in the selection, then you can use the ```enter``` method. This method will append dom elements for the remaining data elements

#### Using anonymous functions in accessor methods
- Any anonymous function called when setting accessor methods can provide you with the data bound to that selection.

Set the contents of the div equal to the value bound to that div:
```
d3.select("body").selectAll("div")
.data(myData)
.enter()
.append("div")
.html(function(d, i) {return d;});
```
d - the data element

i - the index in the array

##Loading Data from a source
d3 has various format-specific methods that can be used to load data from a remote source
### Loading JSON
Loading of remote json data is done asynchronously. A callback must be specified:
```
d3.json('/data.json', function(error, data) {
    //do something with data here
});
```
